# final exam
the final exam was conducted on thursday 29th may 2025 from 9:30am - 1:30pm in MCL-3, Aman. 
- the first hour was PART-A in which we had to attempt 31 MCQS via LMS. 
- then we were allowed to use our own laptops and from 10:30am-1:20pm, we had to solve PART-B which was a case study. We were given an unseen dataset and had to make a dashboard on powerBI with a detailed report. We also had to make an on-paper prototype before the dashboard and give a viva on it during the exam time.

it went well. my partner was Kisa for part-B and we worked together to make a great dashboard. we had to submit:
- dashboard `.pbix`
- report `.pdf`
- handmade prototype `.jpg`
