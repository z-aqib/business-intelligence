# Assignment 3
this is a powerbi assignment due this week, my partner is Kisa. we have to make a multipage dashboard with a comprehensive report.

## dataset
so first we selected the dataset from kaggle, [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset) and then i cleaned the dataset by running the python notebook in this folder, `data_cleaning.ipynb`, the entire notebook was written by me.   
the cleaned dataset was saved as `student_performance_cleaned.csv`

## dashboard
then kisa sent in her dashboard and I had already made some. I will then merge her and my dashboard together   
i did some mistakes so kisa fixed them
