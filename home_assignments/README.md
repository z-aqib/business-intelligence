# Business Intelligence Assignments

## Assignment 1
This Business Intelligence Assignment 1 on OLAP Cube was completed by group members Hamna Inam Abro, Zara Masood, and Zuha Aqib. The team analyzed a customer analytics dataset from Kaggle, focusing on shipment data, customer behavior, and delivery performance. They identified key facts and dimensions, then addressed three business problems: understanding customer retention challenges related to late deliveries and discounts; optimizing warehouse and shipping mode performance, highlighting Warehouse F and the “Ship” method as top performers; and evaluating the effectiveness and delays associated with different shipping modes. The analysis revealed that late deliveries drive customer disengagement, “Ship” mode is the most used yet has a high delay rate, and discounts only partially mitigate churn. Based on these insights, the team recommended targeted retention strategies, operational improvements in warehouses, and prioritizing shipment modes to enhance on-time delivery and customer satisfaction.

## Assignment 2
This CS459 Assignment 02 on Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was completed by Zuha Aqib (ERP: 26106) using a healthcare dataset. The assignment involved identifying and correcting data inconsistencies, handling missing values using both logical strategies and visual tools like missingno, and performing univariate and multivariate analyses to uncover patterns. Key findings included the influence of admission type on billing amount and a strong correlation between billing and tax amounts, while most other attributes showed independence. Several reusable API functions were developed for data cleaning and visualization. The cleaned dataset was saved, and AI tools were minimally used for code structuring in EDA tasks, with all strategic and interpretative work done independently.
