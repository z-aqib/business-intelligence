**Spring 2025**

**Instructor:** Miss Abeera Tariq   

**Group Members:**
* Farah Inayat (ERP: 26912)
* Hamna Inam Abro (ERP: 27113)
* Zehra Ahmed (ERP: 26965)
* Zuha Aqib (ERP: 26106)

## Objective

This activity aimed to help students identify and analyze the application of **Business Intelligence (BI)** in real-world e-commerce platforms. Students were required to explore two different online businesses—**Foodpanda** (a food delivery app) and **Saya Clothing** (a fashion e-commerce store with physical presence)—to understand how BI tools are used to personalize customer experiences, optimize operations, and drive business decisions.

## Task Overview

The activity was divided into three key tasks:

### **Task 1: Spot the BI Features**

Students visited two different e-commerce platforms and identified BI features across areas like:

* User Interface (UI) personalization
* Recommendation systems
* Filters and search optimization
* Product dashboards and analytics
* Dynamic pricing
* Inventory tracking and more

### **Task 2: Comparison with Traditional Retail**

Students compared BI-enabled features of online stores with the traditional shopping experience (e.g., physical stores like Imtiaz, Carrefour, or local kiryana shops).

### **Task 3: Critical Reflection**

Teams reflected on how these systems know when to send notifications, what kind of data is collected, why prices change dynamically, and how recommendations are personalized.

## Case Study 1: **Foodpanda**

### BI Features Identified:

## Comparison with Traditional Retail

**Traditional Shopping vs. BI-Powered E-Commerce:**

| Feature         | Traditional Retail     | BI-Powered E-Commerce                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Recommendations | Generic, manual        | Personalized using past behavior      |
| Inventory       | Manual tracking        | Real-time stock visibility            |
| Promotions      | Same for all customers | Customized by location and behavior   |
| Search          | Manual browsing        | Instant search with predictive typing |
| Reviews         | Word-of-mouth          | Verified ratings and customer reviews |
| Dynamic Pricing | Rare                   | Real-time based on demand/season      |
| Loyalty         | Paper cards (if any)   | Digital rewards and points systems    |

**Key Differences:**
E-commerce platforms use real-time data, AI, and BI tools to provide faster, more efficient, and personalized customer journeys that are not possible in traditional setups.

## BI Reflection (Task 3)

### Why Are Recommendations Shown?

To boost sales, enhance user convenience, promote upselling/cross-selling, and drive customer engagement. BI helps suggest relevant products and offers in real time.

### How Are Notifications Timed?

Systems use behavioral triggers:

* Cart abandonment → reminder email
* Inactivity → “We Miss You” voucher
* Time-based → “Midnight Deal” alerts
* Location-based → “Near You” offers

### What Data Is Collected?

Platforms gather:

* Past orders, browsing history
* Demographics & location
* Device usage, engagement metrics
* Peak times and delivery performance
  This data powers everything from personalized ads to delivery planning.

### Why Do Prices Change?

Dynamic pricing is based on:

* Demand surges (e.g., rainy weather)
* Time (rush hour, holidays)
* Competition (e.g., price drops from other brands)
* Stock levels and user behavior

## Benefits of Business Intelligence (BI)

BI systems lead to:

* Higher order values (through smart suggestions)
* Better customer retention (with loyalty tools)
* Smarter inventory and logistics planning
* Targeted promotions and reduced marketing costs
* Less inventory waste and fewer stockouts
* Faster, data-driven decisions

## Conclusion

This activity successfully demonstrated how real-world platforms like **Foodpanda** and **Saya Clothing** are powered by Business Intelligence to improve customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and drive business growth. The contrast with traditional retail further highlighted how data-driven decision-making gives modern platforms a competitive edge. The group’s analysis shows a solid understanding of how BI is integrated into digital commerce to enhance personalization, boost revenue, and build customer loyalty.
