## Activity Overview

### Tasks Performed:

1. **Data Import & Power Pivot Setup:**

   * Imported multiple datasets (e.g., Sales, Products, Customers, Dates) into Power Pivot.
   * Enabled **Data Model** to establish relationships between tables.

2. **Created Relationships Between Tables:**

   * Linked key fields (e.g., Product ID, Customer ID, Date) to connect the tables.
   * Ensured relational integrity to support cross-table calculations.

3. **Defined Calculated Columns:**

   * Created columns such as `Total Sales`, `Profit`, `Profit Margin` using DAX expressions.
   * These calculated columns made it easier to use business metrics within PivotTables.

4. **Defined Measures using DAX:**

   * Created aggregate measures like:

     * `Total Revenue`
     * `Average Sales`
     * `Total Profit`
     * `Customer Count`
   * Measures allowed summarization and comparison across different segments.

5. **Created KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):**

   * Set thresholds for KPIs (e.g., target profit levels or sales goals).
   * Used visual indicators (green/yellow/red) to reflect performance against these targets.

6. **Built PivotTables and PivotCharts:**

   * Used Power Pivot data model to create insightful PivotTables.
   * Analyzed data across dimensions like:

     * Region
     * Product Category
     * Time (Month/Quarter/Year)
     * Customer Segments

---

## Key Analysis Highlights

* **Profit by Product Category:** Identified which product lines were most and least profitable.
* **Sales Trends Over Time:** Visualized how revenue and profit changed quarterly/monthly.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Compared sales and profits across different customer groups.
* **KPI Tracking:** Evaluated actual performance against targets using KPI indicators.
* **Top Performers:** Pinpointed top-selling products and highest-revenue customers.
