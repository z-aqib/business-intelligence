## 📌 Objective

The goal of this Tableau activity was to create a **business intelligence story** using a dataset from Assignment 01 (Power Pivot). The task was to identify a **new business problem** not already solved in the previous assignment, and use **Tableau** to explore and explain that problem through interactive visuals and insights.

## 📁 What We Did

We built a **Tableau story** that explored the relationship between **discounts**, **product importance**, **shipment performance**, and **customer purchasing patterns**. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of our analysis:

---

## 🔍 Story Insights

* ✅ **Overall KPIs**

  * Total revenue was calculated.
  * The **average discount** offered was **7%**.
  * The **average customer rating** was **3 out of 5**.

* 🚚 **Shipment Mode Performance**

  * **Ship** mode had the **highest rate** of on-time deliveries.
  * **Road** mode was the **least reliable** in terms of timely delivery.

* 📦 **Product Importance vs Shipment Mode**

  * Ship mode was used **mostly for low and medium importance products**.
  * Majority of all products sold were **low or medium importance**.

* 💸 **Discount Patterns**

  * At first, we saw that low importance products had the highest total discount—but this was misleading because it was just the **sum**.
  * We changed the metric to **percentage of discount relative to product cost**, which showed:

    * **Cheaper products** received **higher discounts**.
    * **Expensive products** had **lower discounts**.

* 👤 **Customer Behavior**

  * Most of our customers were **repeat buyers**, making **2 to 3 prior purchases**.
  * This shows good customer retention and potential for loyalty marketing.

* 🏢 **Warehouse Block Performance**

  * We compared warehouse blocks and found that all blocks had a similar average of 2 prior purchases.
  * There wasn’t a clear "best" block based on this metric alone.

## 🧠 Business Problem Identified

We focused on the **relationship between product cost, importance, and discounts**, and how that connects to delivery performance and customer loyalty. The aim was to understand:

* Are we offering discounts wisely?
* Is our shipping mode aligned with product priority?
* Are low-priority products taking up too much of our effort?

---

## 📈 Visualizations Used

* KPI cards (Revenue, Discount %, Ratings)
* Bar charts (Product Importance, Shipment Mode)
* Pie charts (Product Type Distribution)
* Tree maps (Discount by Product Cost)
* Line charts (Delivery on Time by Shipment Mode)
* Customer History Bar Graphs

---

## 🔁 Drill-Down Strategy Snapshot

We used our Assignment 01 drill-down strategy to guide this story. It helped us navigate from overall metrics → product segmentation → shipment performance → customer behavior.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This Tableau activity helped us tell a complete business story using data visuals. We gained new insights about how we handle discounts, which shipment methods work best, and what kind of customers we have. The visuals helped us understand that **discount strategy and delivery performance** can be improved, especially for **low-cost, low-priority products**.
