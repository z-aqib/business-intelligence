# Presentation
so here this was an assignment we got over the weekend in which we had to pair up, pick a dataset and then make a single 1 page dashboard with our pair. we also had to make a report. but then on the following class (monday), we had to present the dashboard in 5 minutes to our teacher - explaining it fully on what it was and what insight we gained. 

my partner was Kisa.
