## Activity 01 - Spot the BI
This Business Intelligence Activity 1, completed by Farah Inayat, Hamna Inam Abro, Zehra Ahmed, and Zuha Aqib, explored how modern e-commerce platforms like Foodpanda and Saya Clothing use BI tools to enhance customer experience, optimize operations, and drive sales. The team identified features such as personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, real-time inventory tracking, and customer behavior analysis. Compared to traditional retail, these BI-powered platforms offer faster, smarter, and more personalized shopping experiences. The activity also reflected on how these systems determine when to send notifications, what data they collect, and how they adjust prices dynamically—all contributing to increased efficiency, higher sales, and stronger customer retention.

## Activity 02 - DB to DWH
This Business Intelligence Activity 2, completed by Zehra Ahmed, Farah Inayat, and Zuha Aqib, focused on transforming a transactional Travel Management System (TMS) database into a data warehouse using a star schema. The group selected the Booking and Payment process as the core business activity due to its high transaction volume and strategic value. They defined the data mart grain at the individual traveler level, identified key facts such as total price, amount paid, and commission earned, and linked them to relevant dimensions like Customer, Package, Payment, Date, and Booking. The resulting star schema supports insights into revenue forecasting, customer behavior, vendor performance, and seasonal trends—enabling efficient, data-driven decision-making for travel businesses.
