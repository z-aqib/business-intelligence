## Activity 01 - Spot the BI
This Business Intelligence Activity 1, completed by Farah Inayat, Hamna Inam Abro, Zehra Ahmed, and Zuha Aqib, explored how modern e-commerce platforms like Foodpanda and Saya Clothing use BI tools to enhance customer experience, optimize operations, and drive sales. The team identified features such as personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, real-time inventory tracking, and customer behavior analysis. Compared to traditional retail, these BI-powered platforms offer faster, smarter, and more personalized shopping experiences. The activity also reflected on how these systems determine when to send notifications, what data they collect, and how they adjust prices dynamically—all contributing to increased efficiency, higher sales, and stronger customer retention.

## Activity 02 - DB to DWH
This Business Intelligence Activity 2, completed by Zehra Ahmed, Farah Inayat, and Zuha Aqib, focused on transforming a transactional Travel Management System (TMS) database into a data warehouse using a star schema. The group selected the Booking and Payment process as the core business activity due to its high transaction volume and strategic value. They defined the data mart grain at the individual traveler level, identified key facts such as total price, amount paid, and commission earned, and linked them to relevant dimensions like Customer, Package, Payment, Date, and Booking. The resulting star schema supports insights into revenue forecasting, customer behavior, vendor performance, and seasonal trends—enabling efficient, data-driven decision-making for travel businesses.

## Activity 03 - Power Pivot
This Power Pivot activity, completed by Zuha Aqib (ERP: 26106), involved building a data model in Excel by importing and connecting multiple datasets using Power Pivot. Relationships were established between tables, and DAX formulas were used to create calculated columns and measures such as Total Revenue, Profit, and Average Sales. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were added to track performance against targets, and PivotTables and charts were used to visualize insights like profit trends, top-performing products, and customer segmentation. The activity demonstrated how Power Pivot can transform raw data into an interactive, analysis-ready model that supports effective business intelligence reporting.

## Activity 04 - EDA
This enhanced statistical analysis activity, completed by Zuha Aqib (ERP: 26106), expanded upon the original class-provided script by adding deeper insights and improved functionality. While the original focused only on basic ANOVA and limited tests on Sales, this version extended the analysis to include Profit, introduced a reusable Tukey test function, performed Chi-square tests across all categorical variable pairs, and added a correlation heatmap for numeric relationships. Data wrangling steps were included to handle missing values, and results were clearly categorized and interpreted. These improvements made the analysis more comprehensive, automated, and insightful for understanding key business drivers in the sales dataset.
