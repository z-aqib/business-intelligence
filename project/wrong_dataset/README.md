so while doing the project my task was to do EDA i.e. data cleaning. i got the dataset `url(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023)` and performed EDA. i even made a report on what i did. and then i later realised that it was the wrong dataset - the actual dataset was `url(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations?select=ColumnDescriptions.txt)` so now im going to redo it all.
